# Should everything be connected?

I think it is possible to have secure IoT devices today, but only if the purchaser is security aware and also specifically chooses to only buy IoT devices which are secure. A careless person buying the cheapest possible device from China will probably be insecure. 

The IoT landscape is rapidly evolving and there are so many different types of devices in different categories so that the attack surface is huge. Still the standard of security can be greatly improved by just doing basic things, such as the ones stated above - not having shared default passwords, disabling remote access and turning off unnecessary services. It would also be necessary to allow the devices to be updated, so that newly found security holes can be patched or certificates updated, such as in the problem which affected Wink in the article.

One idea I would suggest is to have some kind of security standard which would apply to the devices. This could then become a Kitemark[1] which the manufacturer would put on the device and then the purchaser would know that the basic security problems, stated above, were not present. Another idea might be to try to create a standard for the low end devices whereby they would connect through a central hub. Then at least there would be a single place to monitor, update or disable them. This seems to be developing already as the Wink network from the article acts as a hub for Nest thermostats, Philips Hue light bulbs, Chamberlain garage door openers and DropCam cameras. 

The theme here seems to be standardisation, or perhaps a number of different standards grouped roughly by CPU, power usage, networking, etc. This may naturally emerge at some point during the rapid growth and evolution of IoT.
